Input:
```
Which models use Unet architectures?
```

Output:

Okay, so I need to figure out which models use Unet architectures based on the provided search results. Let me go through each model one by one.

Starting with Model #1: Generative-Fashion-MNIST_script_unet. The description says it's a U-Net architecture combined with Fashion MNIST denoising features. So that's definitely using U-Net.

Moving to Model #2: Generative-Fashion-MNIST_latent_new_model. The architecture is described as an Autoencoder with Denoising Diffusion, but I don't see any mention of Unet here. It uses classes like SimpleAutoencoder and UNetResidualBlock. Wait, there's a UNetResidualBlock class, which might be part of the U-Net architecture. But the main component is an autoencoder, not U-Net per se.

Model #3: Generative-Fashion-MNIST_latent_new_conditional_model. The description mentions using ConditionalDenoiseDiffusion and ConditionalUNet. So this one definitely uses a U-Net-like structure called ConditionalUNet.
</think>

Based on the analysis of the provided models:

**Models that use Unet architectures:**

1. **Generative-Fashion-MNIST_script_unet**
   - **Architecture**: U-Net
   - **Description**: Combines U-Net with Fashion MNIST denoising features.

2. **Generative-Fashion-MNIST_latent_new_conditional_model**
   - **Architecture**: ConditionalUNet (part of U-Net family)
   - **Description**: Implements a conditional denoising diffusion autoencoder using U-Net-like blocks.

**Summary:** Two models utilize Unet-based architectures: the first explicitly as a U-Net, and the third through its UNet components.
