Okay, so I need to figure out which Deep Q-Learning model was used for playing the game 2048 based on the provided search results. Let's go through each model one by one and see which fits the description.

First, looking at Model #1: It's called GamePlay_script2048. The file size is 28973, created on March 5, 2025. The framework used is PyTorch 2.7, and it's a model script implementing an AI agent for the game of 2048. The dataset mentioned is also Game2048, which makes sense because that's the game we're interested in. The training configuration includes a batch size of 32, learning rate of 0.001 using the Adam optimizer, and 10 epochs. It mentions using GPU hardware. 

The description says it uses Pygame for GUI display, allowing both learning and evaluation with visual feedback. It also talks about using a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for the DQN model. So this seems to be the model that was specifically trained for playing 2048.

Now looking at Model #2: This one is QandA_script. It uses BERTForQuestionAnswering with a SquadDataset, so it's more related to text processing and answering questions. The configuration has a smaller batch size of 8, learning rate of 0.001, Adam optimizer, 3 epochs, using CUDA if available. This model doesn't seem relevant for the game of 2048.

Model #3: CycleGAN_script. It's based on CycleGAN architecture with two domains (A and B), CIFAR-10 dataset, ResidualBlocks, etc. The training uses GPU again but is focused on image-to-image translation or similar tasks, not relevant to the game of 2048.

So after going through each model, it looks like Model #1 is the one used for playing 2048 because all its details align with a DQN (Deep Q-Learning) agent trying to play and achieve the game's objective.
</think>

The Deep Q-Learning model used for playing the game of 2048 is **Model #1: GamePlay_script2048**. This model was designed specifically for the 2048 game, utilizing a convolutional neural network architecture within a DQN framework to learn optimal strategies.

**Answer:**  
The Deep Q-Learning agent used for playing 2048 is Model #1 - **GamePlay_script2048**.
