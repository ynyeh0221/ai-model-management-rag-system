Okay, so I need to figure out which diffusion models have been trained on the Oxford Flower dataset based on the user's query. Let me start by reading through the search results provided. 

First, there are three models listed: Model #1, Model #2, and Model #3. Each has its own details like architecture, training configuration, and description.

Starting with Model #1: The name suggests it's a Generative model using a SimpleUNet. It was trained on the Flowers102 dataset, which I believe is another name for the Oxford Flower dataset. The training used PyTorch 2.7, Adam optimizer, batch size of 64, learning rate of 0.001, and ran for 10 epochs on CPU. The test split was 5% validation and 99% training with 468 images.

Model #2 is a ConditionalUNet trained on the Oxford Flowers dataset. Its architecture includes modules like Convolutional U-Net and attention mechanisms such as Swish and SpatialAttention. It used a larger batch size of 256, higher learning rate, and ran for 1000 epochs also on CPU.

Model #3 is called ConditionalDenoiseDiffusion. The description mentions it's an end-to-end learned model using UNet to denoise images conditioned on class and color. It uses GPU for training with a batch size of 64, learning rate 0.001, AdamW optimizer, and runs for 1000 epochs.

So all three models were trained on the Oxford Flower dataset or its version (Flowers102). They use different architectures: SimpleUNet, ConditionalUNet with attention, and a Denoising Diffusion model. Each has varying training parameters but was definitely used for flower classification or recognition tasks.

Based on the provided search results, all three diffusion models were trained on versions of the Oxford Flower dataset:

1. **Generative-Oxford-102-Flower_v1**:
   - Trained using PyTorch 2.7 with an Adam optimizer.
   - Batch size: 64, Learning rate: 0.001, Epochs: 10, CPU training.
   - Utilized the Flowers102 dataset (Oxford Flower) for testing.

2. **Generative-Oxford-Flower_v2**:
   - Trained with PyTorch 2.7 using AdamW optimizer.
   - Batch size: 64, Learning rate: 0.001, Epochs: 1000, GPU training.
   - Based on the Oxford Flowers dataset.

3. **Generative-Oxford-Flower_v3**:
   - Trained with PyTorch 2.7 using AdamW optimizer.
   - Batch size: 64, Learning rate: 0.001, Epochs: 1000, GPU training.
   - Based on the improved Oxford Flowers Conditional Dataset.

All models were used for flower classification or generation tasks, leveraging their respective architectures and optimization strategies.
