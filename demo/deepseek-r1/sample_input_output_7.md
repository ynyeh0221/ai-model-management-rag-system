Okay, so I need to figure out how to show models trained on the MNIST dataset using autoencoders based on the given search results. Let me start by looking at each model and its details.

First, Model #1 is called Generative-Fashion-MNIST_latent_new_model. It's built using PyTorch 2.7 with an architecture that combines an Autoencoder with Denoising Diffusion. The code has classes like SimpleAutoencoder, SimpleDenoiseDiffusion, and UNetResidualBlock. The dataset is Fashion MNIST, which I think is similar to MNIST but uses fashion items instead of digits. The training configuration includes a batch size of 256, learning rate of 0.001 with Adam optimizer, weight decay, 1000 epochs on GPU. It's described as an autoencoder for feature extraction and a diffusion-based denoising process.

Then there's Model #2: Generative-Fashion-MNIST_latent_new_conditional_model. This uses ConditionalDenoiseDiffusion and has modules like Encoder, Decoder, UNetAttentionBlock, etc. The dataset is also Fashion MNIST but with a smaller training batch size of 256, learning rate same as Model #1, only 100 epochs on CPU. It's for conditional generation, meaning it can generate images based on specific classes.

Model #3 is MNIST_scriptNN. This seems simpler; it's just a basic neural network using SimpleNN without encoder-decoder parts or attention mechanisms. The dataset is regular MNIST, not Fashion MNIST. Training config has smaller batch size of 64, same learning rate, only 5 epochs on CUDA.

So the user is asking for models trained on MNIST (not Fashion) using autoencoders. Looking at the results, only Model #3 uses MNIST with a SimpleNN, which isn't an autoencoder but just a regular NN. The other two are on Fashion MNIST and use more complex architectures.

I need to compile this information into a clear answer highlighting that none of the models specifically trained on MNIST as an autoencoder except for one using MNIST with a basic NN structure.

Based on the search results, there are no specific models trained directly on the MNIST dataset using an autoencoder architecture. However, here's a summary of the models found:

1. **Model #1**: This model is designed for the Fashion MNIST dataset and uses a combination of an Autoencoder with Denoising Diffusion. It utilizes PyTorch 2.7 and includes modules like SimpleAutoencoder, SimpleDenoiseDiffusion, and UNetResidualBlock. Training details include a batch size of 256, learning rate of 0.001, Adam optimizer with weight decay, and runs for 1000 epochs on GPU.

2. **Model #2**: This model is also based on the Fashion MNIST dataset and uses ConditionalDenoiseDiffusion. It includes modules such as Encoder, Decoder, and UNetAttentionBlock. Training involves a smaller batch size of 256, same learning rate, and runs for only 100 epochs on CPU.

3. **Model #3**: This model is simpler, using a basic neural network structure (SimpleNN) without encoder-decoder components or attention mechanisms. It processes the MNIST dataset but does not use an autoencoder architecture. Training details include a batch size of 64, learning rate of 0.001, Adam optimizer with weight decay, and runs for only 5 epochs on CUDA.

None of these models specifically focus on training an autoencoder directly on the MNIST dataset. The closest is Model #3, which uses a basic neural network structure but not an autoencoder.
