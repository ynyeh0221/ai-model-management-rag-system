Okay, so I need to figure out how to help this user who asked for models trained on the MNIST dataset using autoencoders based on their search results. Let me go through each model step by step and see what information they have.

First up is Model #1: Generative-Fashion-MNIST_latent_new_model. It's an Autoencoder with Denoising Diffusion, built in PyTorch 2.7. The architecture uses an Encoder-Decoder setup with a diffusion process for denoising. They trained it on the Fashion MNIST dataset using a batch size of 256, learning rate of 0.001 with Adam optimizer, and ran it for 1000 epochs on a GPU. It seems like this model combines feature extraction from autoencoders with diffusion-based denoising to generate new images with diverse styles.

Next is Model #2: Generative-Fashion-MNIST_latent_new_conditional_model. This one also uses PyTorch 2.7 but adds conditional aspects, I think. It has layers for Unet and ConditionalDenoiseDiffusion. They used AdamW optimizer with weight decay and trained it conditionally on target classes. The evaluation involved metrics like accuracy and reconstruction error, and they did t-SNE visualizations of the latent space. This model is probably conditioned to generate images specific to certain classes.

Then there's Model #3: Generative-Fashion-MNIST_transformer_new_diff_loss. This one uses an Efficient Transformer Denoiser. The architecture includes positional encoding layers, linear attention, and efficient transformer blocks. It was trained with a smaller batch size of 128, learning rate of 0.0003, using AdamW optimizer on CPU. They used mixed precision for faster training. This model seems to leverage transformers for denoising but didn't mention any specific conditional aspects.

The user wants information about these models, so I should summarize each one based on the provided details. I'll outline their architecture, training specifics, and key features or differences from each other.

Here is a summary of the three models trained on the MNIST dataset using autoencoders based on your search results:

### Model #1: Generative-Fashion-MNIST_latent_new_model
**Architecture:**  
- **Autoencoder with Denoising Diffusion**: Combines an Encoder-Decoder architecture with a diffusion process to denoise images and generate new ones. The model includes positional encoding layers, linear attention layers, efficient transformer blocks, patch embedding, and the main denoiser module.

**Training Details:**  
- **Dataset:** Fashion MNIST (binary classification dataset).  
- **Batch Size:** 128 for Model #3; others vary.  
- **Learning Rate:** 0.0003 for Model #3, others are not specified in detail.  
- **Optimizer:** AdamW with weight decay mentioned for some models.  
- **Epochs:** 50 for Model #3; others are not detailed but likely similar.  
- **Hardware:** Trained on CPU for Model #3.

**Key Features:**  
- Uses diffusion-based denoising to generate new images.  
- Includes transformer components (efficient transformer block) and patch embedding layers.  
- Mixed precision training for faster speed.

### Model #2: Generative-Fashion-MNIST_latent_new_conditional_model
**Architecture:**  
- **Conditional Denoising Autoencoder**: Extends the basic autoencoder to condition outputs based on target classes, likely using Unet and ConditionalDenoiseDiffusion models.  

**Training Details:**  
- **Batch Size:** 128 for Model #3; others vary.  
- **Learning Rate:** 0.001 with Adam optimizer for Model #1. For Model #2, it's not explicitly mentioned but possibly similar given the context.  
- **Epochs:** 1000 for Model #1.  
- **Hardware:** Trained on GPU.

**Key Features:**  
- Conditioned to generate images specific to certain classes.  
- Evaluation includes accuracy and reconstruction error metrics.  
- Uses t-SNE visualizations of latent space and GIF animations for diffusion processes with different target classes.

### Model #3: Generative-Fashion-MNIST_transformer_new_diff_loss
**Architecture:**  
- **Efficient Transformer Denoiser**: Uses transformer components (positional encoding, linear attention) within an EfficientTransformerDenoiser module.  

**Training Details:**  
- **Dataset:** Fashion MNIST.  
- **Batch Size:** 128.  
- **Learning Rate:** 0.0003 with AdamW optimizer and weight decay of 0.05.  
- **Epochs:** 50.  
- **Hardware:** Trained on CPU.

**Key Features:**  
- Leverages transformer components for denoising but does not mention conditional aspects.  
- Uses mixed precision training for faster training speed (amortized 3x faster).
