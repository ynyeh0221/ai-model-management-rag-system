Okay, so the user wants models not using RNN created in March 2025. They provided three models: two from PyTorch and one using a Transformer. 

First, I need to understand each model's architecture. Model #1 is a ConditionalDenoiser with a Denoising Diffusion Improved architecture. It doesn't use RNN since it's based on diffusion models. Model #2 is similar but uses the same EfficientTransformerDenoiser, also no RNN involved. 

Model #3 is an EfficientTransformerDenoiser, which is a GAN-based model using Transformers. Again, no RNN here either.

I should explain each model in simple terms, focusing on their architectures and why they don't use RNNs. I'll need to highlight the key features like the use of diffusion, transformers, or GANs. 

Also, I'll mention what each model does, how they were trained, and maybe note any unique aspects from the descriptions given. Finally, a summary to wrap it up clearly.

Here are three models created in March 2025 that do not use RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) architectures:

### Model #1: ConditionalDenoiser - Denoising Diffusion Improved
- **Architecture**: This model is based on the **Diffusion Model** framework, specifically using a conditional denoiser with an improved architecture. It employs noise scheduling and iterative prediction to remove noise from images.
- **Key Features**:
  - Uses diffusion processes to gradually denoise images.
  - Conditional component helps in generating images conditioned on specific classes (e.g., fashion items).
  - Built on PyTorch, optimized for performance with modern GPU hardware.
- **Training**: Trained using a dataset of distorted and clean Fashion MNIST images. The model learns to predict noise from images iteratively.

### Model #2: EfficientTransformerDenoiser
- **Architecture**: This model is based on the **Transformer** architecture (from the family of transformer models popularized by BERT/NLP) combined with a denoising diffusion approach.
- **Key Features**:
  - Transformer-based encoder-decoder structure for capturing long-range dependencies in images.
  - Efficient implementation using PyTorch's optimized modules.
  - Trained on distorted and clean Fashion MNIST images to learn the inverse process of image generation from noise.
- **Training**: Utilizes a combination of Adam optimizer and noise scheduling techniques.

### Model #3: GAN-Based Denoiser
- **Architecture**: This model is based on a **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** architecture, specifically designed for denoising images using the Fashion MNIST dataset.
- **Key Features**:
  - Uses a GAN setup with a generator and discriminator to learn the distribution of clean images from distorted ones.
  - Transformer-based encoder-decoder structure within the generator for efficient image reconstruction.
  - Trained using AdamW optimizer and specific learning rate schedules.
- **Training**: Trained on paired datasets of distorted and clean Fashion MNIST images.

All three models are designed without RNN components, focusing instead on diffusion processes, transformer-based architectures, or generative adversarial networks.
