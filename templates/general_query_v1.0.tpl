User Query: {{ query }}

I found exactly {{ results|length }} models created in April. Here is the information for each model:

{% for model in results %}
MODEL #{{ loop.index }}: {{ model.model_id }}
- Creation Date: {{ model.metadata.created_at }}
- Last Modified Date: Extract from file data
- File Size: Extract from file data
- Absolute Path: Extract from file data
- File data (JSON string): {{ model.metadata.file }}
{% endfor %}

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Create a table showing ONLY these specific {{ results|length }} model IDs:
{% for model in results %}
   - {{ model.model_id }}
{% endfor %}

2. For each model, extract the File Size and Absolute Path from the JSON string in the file data
3. DO NOT INVENT ANY MODEL NAMES OR DATA
4. EVERY model must be included in the table with its correct information

After the table, provide a brief analysis of the models.
