            "### INPUT FORMAT SPECIFICATION\n\n"
            "You will receive an AST digest summary of a Python ML training model_script. This structured representation contains "
            "information about imports, classes, functions, variable assignments, and method calls that collectively define "
            "the ML model implementation. Your task is to analyze this digest and extract specific metadata fields.\n\n"
        
            "### EXTRACTION METHODOLOGY\n\n"
            "Apply these systematic extraction principles:\n"
            "- Perform a comprehensive scan of the entire AST digest before making determinations\n"
            "- Identify component relationships and architectural patterns rather than isolated elements\n"
            "- Trace data flow and parameter usage throughout the model_script\n"
            "- Recognize standard ML implementation patterns and their signatures\n"
            "- Maintain absolute fidelity to information present in the AST—never invent or assume values\n"
            "- Use specified fallback values (null or \"missing\") when information cannot be reliably extracted\n\n"
