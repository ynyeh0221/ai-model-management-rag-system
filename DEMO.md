# AI Model Management RAG System Capabilities Demo

## Overview

ModelSearch AI is a powerful model search and retrieval system designed for machine learning researchers and engineers. The system enables intelligent searching across large model repositories, retrieving model information based on various criteria and providing structured outputs.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Model Attribute-Based Retrieval

The system supports model retrieval based on the following attributes:

- **Architecture types**: CNN, RNN, UNet, etc.
- **Frameworks**: PyTorch, etc.
- **Datasets**: MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, Oxford Flower, etc.
- **Time ranges**: Filter by creation or modification date
- **Specific applications**: Such as game AI (2048 game)

**Example queries:**
```
Which models use Unet architectures?
Please find models created in March 2025 and using CNN.
List all seq2seq models that use attention mechanisms.
```

### 2. Specific Model Details Retrieval

The system provides detailed information about specific models, including:

- Model ID
- File size
- Creation date
- Last modification date
- Framework information
- Architecture details
- Training dataset
- Training configuration (batch size, learning rate, optimizer, etc.)
- Full description

**Example query:**
```
What DQN (Deep Q-Learning) agent did I try for the game called 2048?
```

### 3. Generated Image Retrieval

The system supports retrieving images generated by specific models, providing detailed metadata:

- Image ID
- Parent model ID
- Creation date
- Last modification date
- Training epoch
- Image path

**Example query:**
```
please find images of model id oxford_flowers_conditional
```

### 4. Dataset Exploration

The system can explore various models trained on specific datasets:

**Example query:**
```
What diffusion models have been trained on the Oxford Flower dataset?
Show me models trained on the MNIST dataset using autoencoder.
```

## Output Formats

The system provides several formatted outputs:

1. **Tabular format**: Structured display of model information, including similarity scores, file sizes, creation dates, etc.
2. **Detailed descriptions**: Comprehensive information about model architecture, training parameters, and performance metrics
3. **Image listings**: Display of model-generated images and related metadata

## Use Case Scenarios

### Researcher Use Cases

- Find recent implementations of specific architectures
- Compare different models trained on the same dataset
- Track model training progress and results

### Engineer Use Cases

- Find pre-trained models suitable for specific applications
- Retrieve sample images generated by models
- Access model training configuration details to reproduce experiments

## Limitations and Notes

- Thumbnail display is not supported in CLI mode
- Image-to-image similarity search is not available in CLI mode
- Some complex semantic queries may require specific technical terminology for best results
- Search results may sometimes be truncated in responses
